### Intended Learning Outcomes

After passing the course, the students should be able to:
1. Analyse, explain, modify, and enhance a simple program in terms of fundamental program constructs and concepts.
2. Describe how numerical and character-based data are represented and discuss the use of primitive data types and built-in data structures.
3. Design, implement, test, and troubleshoot a program that uses basic calculations, simple I/O, common conditional and iteration structures, and function definitions.
4. Discuss the importance of algorithms, identify the necessary properties of good algorithms, and create algorithms to solve simple problems.
5. Develop code that handles exceptional states during execution.
6. Defend the philosophy behind object-oriented design and the concepts of encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.
7. Design, implement, test, and troubleshoot simple programs in an object-oriented programming language.
